@dlo07p @tiktok_us It really sucks. I see girls basically naked shaking their ass in the camera or guys holding a towel over their junk but my cosplays get taken down. Nice 👍🏻
------------------------------------------------
I made my first TikTok &amp; they removed the sound lmao I’m a failure
------------------------------------------------
I got bullied by someone on TikTok, they stole my videos, pictures of me, posted pics of my ex, and then reported my videos. The ones with the fake farts were all taken down, I’m temporarily suspended and can’t upload anything, and they reported one of my videos promotes suicide
------------------------------------------------
I hate that I could’ve been a paid creator on tiktok since over a year ago but tiktok is so fucking transphobic towards my content that has over 100k views 🫠

Juneteenth falling on Father’s Day must have Google working overtime. White people are busy googling “what is Juneteenth,” while black people are googling “what is a Father?”

When you were showering Chris Rufo with praise—after he said he was basically turning everything about Black people into CRT—did you think he might do that with anything the right views as sexually deviant like being trans or gay? Or do you not have that capacity for thought. https://t.co/9GIIpdYdue
------------------------------------------------
I’m furious that other people— ESPECIALLY low income and POC— will be denied the same kind of care I received when I needed it. And don’t you think for a moment they’ll stop at abortions. This SCOTUS decision threatens contraception, LGBTQ+ rights, interracial marriage and more.

black people are not israelites or jews please stop nigga😂😂😂😂

@JPHusker_ stop having your skin color kill african americans then talk piece of shit ..

@patrickknight52 @ellievhall He's a coon. Clarence Thomas would have been one of the Black people snitching on slaves trying to escape. That's says all you need to know about him.

Key observation from #ApeFest. BAYC holders apparently think I am either @takashipom or @beijingdou.

It’s been funny watching reactions wen I ask them if it’s because I’m Asian, but… is it only bc I’m Asian with long hair? Note, no POC asked me this.

Today, President Biden addressed the #RoevWade ruling saying, “the health and life of women in this nation are now at risk.” President Biden, and all elected officials, the lives of Black girls and women have been at risk since African women were brought to this country 4/6
------------------------------------------------
This is + was never about babies or prochoice. It’s about control - control over Black people, poor people, disabled people, and immigrant people. The state has always been a site for harm + control over cis and trans Black girls, women, and gender expansive people. #RoeVWade 3/6

6.24.22: I realize I'm "a racist" for even noticing this, but what is the REASON, that even though blacks are 13% of the US population, at least 40% of the voice actors, (chosen bc their voices are recognized as African-American), on radio ads are black folks?
------------------------------------------------
Why do they resist when it’s so pointless? Dad explains to Jack that it was necessary to save the family. He got fair price for him from Mr Kasim, who promised to treat him decently. Now he could pay the Reparations Tax for this year and keep the entire family from being sold. https://t.co/J3twC1fjkv
------------------------------------------------
@RossKneeDeep I think that it has always been bad. I think that it has been hidden since the civil rights movement may be from mainstream White people But certainly not from black people.
------------------------------------------------
I think it's straight bullshit and it needs to stop.

It’s past time for the @LAGOP to do the right thing and approve a 2nd Congressional District the For African American Representation. You do it or the Judge will . Don’t be Stuck on Stupid, @LaDemos @LouisianaGov #lalege #Colbert @theadvocatebr @NOLAnews @Newsweek #Louisiana

You can tell that is a yt family cause ain’t no way an African, black or cultural family can have that type of animosity for that request, especially when It’s your niece! https://t.co/w5fEmPcN7l

@ronthacreator The album was very unique, but of course black people as a whole do not listen to House 🏡 music. He’s diving a bigger audience to revenue more money…look at the bigger picture, especially with TikTok.

@EliseStefanik What happened to you?  Do you teach your children to hate Black people?  #RepubliKlanGarbage https://t.co/jw8eCpXPiG

@scrowder You a b&amp;$! because that was never a problem since people are saying black live matter as a protest to the police brutality of unarmed African-American. So now it’s all lives matter eat a di🍆.

Soooo Juneteenth will be Black people staying home and getting paid and Wipeepo going to work and handing over those wages to a designated Black family, right?

@ninaturner Regarding reparations r u taking in2 account others that r mixed with black..do they not matter? What percentage of black must u be? Will there b blood testing to see if there's African decedent in them? How exactly would this be? How exactly would reparations go..seriously how?

@theskyismymuse @RossKneeDeep Yep. Carol Theater in Albertville. Black people sat in balcony, separate entrance. Also. Forced busing to only school for black children in the county
------------------------------------------------
@ninaturner My questions are these..who gets reparations? How would reparations be determined? What about mixed children? What about Indigenous descendants? What about Puerto Ricans that women were experimented on so they couldn't have babies and their island was stripped of its resources?
------------------------------------------------
It’s interesting that White opponents of the Black Lives Movement are only interested in talking to White advocates of the Movement, for the most part. Their best source of information is Black People. Yet they fear talking to them about the oppressed condition. PEACE !!

@w_terrence Terrence take a moment to use your head and think about how generations of white bigots compared African Americans to being lower than apes as a means to further their delusional fantasy of superiority.
------------------------------------------------
@BrianRupp16 @drquinngyn It’s absolutely the American that POC’s and women have lived in for centuries, the only ones with true “freedom” has always been white men 🤷🏾‍♀️ why y’all act like this is new?!
------------------------------------------------
@niywashere That are amazing. Also black people created rock and roll and country so why would hating only trap music be anti black when we’re everywhere in music because we pioneered it?
------------------------------------------------

@WhipClyburn Man SPIT GAME about IMMEDIATE Lineage Based REPARATIONS for FBA/ or an ANTI BLACK HATE CRIME BILL otherwise you can KICK ROCKS. To use a Gullah/Geechee expression if you ain’t “Cracking Your Teeth” about Reparations 1st, who cares? Tenki, Tenki.😂😂
------------------------------------------------
yt people saying not to riot. of course. honestly, i’ve gotten to the point where i strongly believe that nothing is gonna happen till yt people start rioting in the streets.  the government doesn’t take poc’s seriously, &amp; yts just be comfortable so the government stays happy https://t.co/8PhgyGNJMR

@YoungestOlG Black people ain’t waiting till after 15weeks to get an abortion anyways. That’s that YT people stuff
------------------------------------------------
Also the fact that we can now exercise our 2nd amendment right to bear arms but you’re saying its not a good idea is anti-black and perpetuates white supremacy ideals about POC owning guns. Take this as an opportunity to learn how to shoot 🤷🏾‍♂️

okay so what’s everyone else’s excuse then ? cus here in reno nevada we have pub crawls &amp; wine walks for everything. mostly orchestrated by yt people but black people enjoying our day is where y’all draw the line? interesting https://t.co/emYzUU8D4k

1/4 Dear Black Prophets, Co. been proud. And we have deep gratitude for the pioneers of Pride culture which echos globally &amp; sometimes without recognition of its African/ Black origins.

It wasn’t because of “anti-hate crimes” or “anti-black vitriol”… That’s stupid.. That’s not what we have to deal with in their own neighborhoods. It’s because of the rise in crime around us from liberal policies.. @DLoesch @MrColionNoir  https://t.co/ph93KsznqX
